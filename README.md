# PlayDash - Flutter Project
Hello everyone, how are you? May this new year bring you more happiness from God.

This time, I want to introduce you to a Flutter-based mobile application with the theme of the game dashboard menu.

### PlayDash - Technology
There are several packages that I used while developing the PlayDash app. All of them are available on the pub.dev website with the following details:
- [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [delayed_display](https://pub.dev/packages/delayed_display)
- [smooth_star_rating](https://pub.dev/packages/smooth_star_rating)
- [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)

### PlayDash - About
The PlayDash project directory consists of 4 packages and 1 main.dart file as a starting point. Every package that I make I make a supporting component when creating a dashboard view with the details of the package I made:
- component
- interface
- models
- pages

### PlayDash - Open Source
For those of you who want to develop this PlayDash application even better, I invite you with a note that your goal is for good. Besides, if you really want to make this app commercial, please contact me.
